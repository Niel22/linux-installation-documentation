            <h2>Prerequisites</h2>
            <h3>1. Hardware Requirements</h3>
            <p>To run Linux Mint on a virtual machine, your system needs to meet the following hardware specifications. These are typical for most modern computers, but you should verify your system's capabilities to avoid any performance issues.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Processor (CPU):</strong> A 64-bit processor is required to run Linux Mint and VirtualBox. Most modern processors from Intel and AMD (e.g., Intel Core i3/i5/i7 or AMD Ryzen series) are suitable.<br> 
                <em>Tip:</em> Check if your CPU supports virtualization (Intel VT-x or AMD-V) in the BIOS settings.</li>
                <li><strong>RAM (Memory):</strong><br>
                ✔ Minimum: 4 GB<br>
                ✔ Recommended: 8 GB or more<br>
                The more RAM you allocate to the virtual machine, the better the performance. However, leave some RAM for your host system (your main operating system).</li>
                <li><strong>Storage (Hard Drive Space):</strong><br>
                ✔ Minimum: 20 GB free space<br>
                ✔ Recommended: 40 GB or more<br>
                Virtual machines need disk space for both the virtual operating system (Linux Mint) and any applications you plan to install. Allocate sufficient space for smooth operation.</li>
                <li><strong>Graphics:</strong> Any modern integrated or dedicated graphics card should work fine. VirtualBox provides basic graphics acceleration, but high-end graphics are not a priority for Linux Mint on a VM unless you plan to run graphically intensive applications.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>2. Software Requirements</h3>
            <p>You’ll need to install the following software on your host system to be able to create and manage the virtual machine and install Linux Mint.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Virtualization Software:</strong><br>
                ✔ VirtualBox (recommended): VirtualBox is a free and open-source tool for creating and managing virtual machines.<br>
                ✔ Download from the official website: VirtualBox Downloads.<br>
                ✔ Alternative: VMware Workstation Player (also free) can be used, but the steps in this guide assume VirtualBox.</li>
                <li><strong>Linux Mint ISO File:</strong> You need the installation file for Linux Mint in ISO format. The latest version can be downloaded from the official Linux Mint website.<br>
                ✔ Download Link: Linux Mint Download Page.<br>
                ✔ Select the desired desktop environment (Cinnamon, MATE, or Xfce) and download the ISO. Cinnamon is the most popular and offers the most modern experience.</li>
                <li><strong>Host Operating System:</strong> Your host system can be any modern operating system such as:<br>
                ✔ Windows: Windows 7, 8, 10, or 11.<br>
                ✔ macOS: Any version that supports VirtualBox.<br>
                ✔ Linux: Any major Linux distribution (Ubuntu, Fedora, etc.).</li>
                <li><strong>Internet Connection:</strong> While not strictly required for installation, an internet connection is recommended for downloading updates, additional software, and VirtualBox Guest Additions for better performance.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>3. BIOS Settings (for Virtualization)</h3>
            <p>To run a virtual machine, virtualization technology (VT-x for Intel or AMD-V for AMD processors) must be enabled in the BIOS of your laptop or desktop. This feature is often disabled by default but can be easily turned on.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Restart your laptop/PC and enter BIOS or UEFI settings (press a key such as Esc, F2, F10, or Del during startup — this varies by manufacturer).</li>
                <li>In the BIOS menu, look for a setting named Intel Virtualization Technology, Intel VT-x, AMD-V, or something similar under Advanced, CPU Configuration, or System Configuration.</li>
                <li>Enable the setting and save changes before exiting BIOS.</li>
                <li>Your system will now be able to run VirtualBox and other virtualization tools.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>4. Backup Important Data</h3>
            <p>Before starting the installation of any new system, including running Linux Mint on a VM, it's always a good idea to back up important files on your host system. While this guide will not affect your main operating system, it's a precautionary step to avoid data loss during the setup process.</p>

            <h3>Summary of Prerequisites</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Hardware:</strong> 64-bit CPU, at least 4 GB of RAM (8 GB recommended), 20 GB free storage space.</li>
